I loved going to the library. I was always a sponge for knowledge. I get that from my mom, I think. Curious about everything, and devouring books. I could check out the maximum every time and have them all read by the time the next trip to the library happened.

I used to sit and read books in class in high school, because I was bored with class. I wasn't a bad student and always got As, but the pace was too slow. So I read. A few teachers, like Mr Hunt, encouraged me and gave me books to read and discuss.
