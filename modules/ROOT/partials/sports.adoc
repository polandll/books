I remember loving sports, but not being brilliant, any kind of standout. What I liked about sports was the learning how to do something new, like badminton. Or the calming effect it had on me, like running in the early morning. I wasn't a hyperactive kid by any means, but I did like to move around. Equally as much as I loved reading.
