Easter was always an interesting time of year. There were pluses and minuses. My mom always wanted to dress me up in little girl clothes and curl my hair. I waas never that kind of girl, much to her chagrin. But Easter also meant playing with my cousins, hide and seek, looking for Easter eggs, smashing a pinata. I have good memories of those times.
